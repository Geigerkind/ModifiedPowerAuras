### Ideas ###

```
#!
Gazpy:
- Add display for targets debuff -- DONE

Iskatu:
- Allow the number of stacks of a certain buff (or debuff?) to show on top of the timer. (For example warrior's enrage that starts with 12 stacks and has one stack consumed each hit, or proccs from weapons like bonereaver's edge, that can stack up to 3 times - the latter would be incredibly useful for me personally) -- DONE

Rhena:
- Make it show ability cooldowns as well and i will consider using this. -- DONE

TaurenRogue
- What i'd like to see is support for 2 x crusader buff -- DONE
